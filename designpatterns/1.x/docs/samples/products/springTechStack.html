<br />
Development Framework - Setup
</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>Automated setup and scaffolding are techniques supported by some frameworks, in which developers can specify an applications usage and capabilities without directly interacting with the framework's configuration internals. Specificationis performed through a UI or by customizing standard configuration files (e.g. POM.XML)  The compiler or framework uses this specification, together with pre-defined code templates, to generate a startup applicaton.  Templated systems effectively treats the templates as a "scaffold" on which to build an integrated application with pre-defined dependencies.  The outcome is a simplified setup process.</p>
<u><strong>Typical features</strong></u>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;list-style-position: inside;padding-left:0;">
	<li>Generation of standard folder layouts</li>
	<li>Creating inclusion and dependency management files: POM, package.json, gulpfile.js, etc.</li>
	<li>Definition of end to end connector suites</li>
</ul>
<p>Scaffolding is an evolution of code generators from earlier development environments, such as Oracle's CASE Generator, and many other 4GL client-server software development products.</p>

USAGE
-------------
<p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that "just run". Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so developers can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;padding-left:0;">
<li>Create stand-alone Spring applications/li>
<li>Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)/li>
<li>Provide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration/li>
<li>Automatically configure Spring whenever possible/li>
<li>Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration/li>
<li>Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration</li>
</ul>


<h3>CURRENT STATE</h3>
Spring Boot 4.3.10

<h3>FUTURE STATE</h3>
Spring Boot 5.x.x

<h2>CORE-0200 - Development Framework - Core</h2>
<p>
CORE-0200
<br />
Development Framework - Core
</p>

DESCRIPTION
------------
<p>A software abstraction providing generic functionality selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or solution.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;padding-left:0;">
	<li>Inversion of control</li>
	<li>Default behavior<br/></li>
	<li>Extensibility</li>
	<li>Non-modifiable framework code</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: red;"><strong>Developer&#39;s Note:</strong>&#160;&#160;Not all components in Spring are approved for use (e.g. embedded tomcat), and some, like hateoas, require specific use approval</p>
</div>

USAGE
-------------
<p>The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;padding-left:0;">
	<li>Dependency Injection</li>
	<li>Aspect-Oriented Programming including Spring's declarative transaction management</li>
	<li>Spring MVC web application and RESTful web service framework</li>
	<li>Foundational support for JDBC, JPA, JMS</li>
	<li>Much more…</li>
</ul>
